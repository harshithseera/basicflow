# BasicFlow

Course repository for CS7.404 Digital Image Processing.

## Overview

BasicFlow is a simplified implementation of the pipeline for SteadyFlow based on "SteadyFlow: Spatially Smooth Optical Flow for Video Stabilization" by Shuaicheng Liu, Lu Yuan, Ping Tan, Jian Sun.

SteadyFlow stabilizes videos by enforcing spatial smoothness on optical flow, removing discontinuous motion, and smoothing per-pixel motion profiles instead of feature trajectories.
